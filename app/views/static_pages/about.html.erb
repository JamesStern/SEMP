<h3>About GW SEAP</h3></br>
<p>The GW Science and Engineering Apprentice Program (SEAP), sponsored by The George Washington University and Analytic Services, Inc., is an eight week summer program for high school students. SEAP is designed so that students can apprentice in fields of their choice with experienced scientists and engineers. This opportunity provides students with valuable experience needed to make informed career decisions. Students apprentice with their mentors on mutually agreed upon projects. Because of the setting, students are treated as research assistants rather than just teenagers. First year participants are awarded an educational stipend of $2000.</br></br>

The students contribute to the research of the Analytic Services, Inc., while learning research techniques in the process. This "hands-on" experience gives students a broader view of their fields of interest and shows students what kind of work awaits them in their future career.  At the end of the summer, the students prepare final reports and present their research at a final seminar.</br></br>
